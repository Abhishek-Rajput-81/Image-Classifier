# Image_Classifier

Image Classifier is a software tool designed for automated image quality assessment, focusing on detecting blur and noise in digital images. It employs image processing techniques such as Local variance analysis, Laplacian filtering, and statistical metrics like Kurtosis and Standard deviation. The tool classifies images into categories like Good Quality, Blurry (Gaussian or Motion Blur), and Noisy (Salt-and-Pepper or Gaussian Noise). Implemented using Python, OpenCV, NumPy, and SciPy, this project enhances efficiency by providing an objective and consistent approach to image quality evaluation, eliminating the need for manual inspection.
